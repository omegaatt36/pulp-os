# X4 EPD driver wire-trace lock (T6). The X4 driver's pure sequences and the
# strip layout moved into pulp-board-logic; this proves the real X4 driver
# source (kernel/src/drivers/{ssd1677,strip}.rs, unmodified, not a copy) still
# emits the byte-for-byte same SPI/DC/RST/delay trace as before the move.
#
# How: build the two kernel files on the host against a tiny esp-hal shim
# (Delay + Instant only) and fakes for SPI/DC/RST/BUSY, drive init, a full
# frame, 7 partial regions (both phase-1 variants, phase 3), deep sleep, and
# hash the recorded trace. PINNED_SHA256 was produced from the pre-T6 sources
# (git HEAD 3bb911af kernel/src/drivers/{ssd1677,strip}.rs), so a mismatch means
# X4 behavior changed. Update the pin only for an intentional X4 change.
#
# Needs a host rustc (any recent stable; the repo's riscv nightly is not
# involved: the temp crate lives outside the repo) and the cargo registry
# cache (embedded-hal, embedded-hal-async, embedded-graphics-core, log).
