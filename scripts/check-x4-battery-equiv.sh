# X4 battery equivalence lock (T9). The voltage -> percent algorithm and the
# discharge table moved from kernel/src/{drivers,board}/battery.rs into
# pulp-board-logic (`battery`, shared with the OnePage C61). This proves the
# REAL X4 files (not copies) give the same adc_to_battery_mv() and
# battery_percentage() for every u16 input as the files at git HEAD (pre-T9).
#
# How: host-compile the pre-T9 files (git show HEAD:...) and the working-tree
# files into two harness builds, print "mv adc_to_battery_mv percentage" for
# 0..=65535, and compare the two outputs (sha256 + diff). PINNED_SHA256 is the
# hash of the pre-T9 output; the new files must reproduce it.
#
# Needs a host rustc and git. No registry access: the only dependency is the
# zero-dependency board-logic path crate.
